One of my first major accomplishments when I started my first job titled "Junior Developer" at TIAG (The Information Applications Group) based out of Charleston, SC was developing a site from the ground up that had been lost in a previous migration attempt by another party. I was assigned this role and I can remember being extremely excited about the opportunity but, also pretty nervous having only worked on several other smaller goverment projects up to that point. My director, Ashley Puerzer of TIAG at the time asked me if I thought I could get involved and make an impact and I believed that I could. My assignment was building out a brand new SharePoint application from a blank slate and this project carried me over the course of 2 years while I continued working under TIAG. I experienced multiple different client-facing roles including that of a tech lead, I participated as a project manager, A mentor to other junior developers, and received promotion while working on this project in particular. Growing with this project and the client over the course of 2 years really put me in a place to not only make a massive positive impact on the way we were conducting congressionally mandated research but, the experience and confidence to build new features from scratch and turn it into a powerful tool for others to utilize.

Some of the major take aways from this project were as follows:

- helped organize and conduct a major SharePoint upgrade (2016)
- participated in archtecture and design meetings with senior developers
- implimented all new features and requirements as part of a brand new SharePoint site
- championed moderniation and moving towards using ES6 helper methods and away from legacy browsers such as Internet Explorer
- acted as interim project lead in addition to development duties when the project was fairly small
- performed in client facing roles as the technical lead in charge of walking the client through any and all technical updates and changes
- responsible for the build process used to promote development work through various environments
- responsible for managing and ensuring 100% passing Fortify scans for every deployment
- sharpening my development skills by learning the ins and outs of JavaScript and associated libraries
- working within the confines of legacy code adjacent to the site we were building to ensure compatibility and future proofing when possible
- my crowning accomplishment was hearing Patty Morris, my client thank my team for "doing what was told impossible" upon completion of the working tool
- the tool I helped develop directly contributes to funding related to the Defense and Veterans Eye Injury & Vision Registry
- the opportunity to serve US veterans by creating impactful real world products to be used for research purposes
