Working for Booz was like getting the call up from the minor leagues to go play for a major league team. The company is deeply involved in the modernization of the Veteran's Affairs and other goverment projects but, my contributions mostly revolve around developing and refactoring applications using React with TypeScript to enable Veterans to receive their benefits faster. Some of the more notable parts of the project were updating the React components from class based to the latest functional components in addition to using the latest and greatest hooks React provides. We try our best to commit to a Test Driven Development (TDD) approach by writing Jest tests first and then writing code to solve. We take the same approach with our backend Java tests. This project has given me lots of reps in creating critical components and hooks that contribute significally by being testable, reusable, and data intensive:

- Upskilling to React with TypeScript to support multiple projects.
- Bug management on a massive VA(Veterans Affairs) application
- Refactoring both frontend and backend components to improve performance
- Organizing API calls by functionality
- Actively participating in code reviews
- Mentoring junior developers and other teammates
- Contributing to 4+1 Architecture documentation and planning
- Defect management
