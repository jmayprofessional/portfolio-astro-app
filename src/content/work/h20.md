I had the luxury of working on a prototype where the client more or less challenged us to build the best reusable components possible within a certain time frame. We built these as part of a larger overarching SDK project but, my focus was ramping up and creating reusable, dynamic Vue.js components that would be immediately implimented and used to build out our SDK documentation page. I didn't get to spend a terrible amount of time on the project before transitioning to another but, I did learn Vue.js relatively quickly in addition to creating a working searchbar, navigation, and several other smaller components that contributed to an overall successful project. This project received funding for a second time, so I like to think that my contributions to the component library were impactful and contributed in a positive way to the overall success of the project. 

#### Biggest accomplishments for the Vue.js component library for the SDK project:

- upskilling to Vue.js in a very very short amount of time (2-3 weeks).
- creating a working navigation component
- creating a search bar component that spanned sitewide using key terms
- creating multiple "helper" components 
- organizing components using Atomic Design
- actively participating in code reviews
- mentoring junior developers and other team mates
- participating in code reviews
- strategizing and planning for the overall success of the project
- defect management
