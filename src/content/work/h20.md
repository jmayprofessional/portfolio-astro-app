  - Vue.js
  - Experimental
  - Atomic Design

I had the opportunity to work on a prototype where the client challenged us to build the best reusable components possible within a specific time frame. These components were part of a larger overarching SDK project, but my main focus was on ramping up and creating reusable, dynamic Vue.js components that would be immediately implemented and used to build out our SDK documentation page. Although I didn't have a significant amount of time on the project before transitioning to another, I quickly learned Vue.js and created a working search bar, navigation, and several other smaller components that played a role in the overall success of the project. This project received funding for a second time, so I believe that my contributions to the component library had a positive impact and contributed to its success.

#### Biggest accomplishments for the NIWC MIP SDK Vue.js component library besides winning a highly coveted "Disruptive Tech Summit 2023" award:

- Upskilling to Vue.js in a very short amount of time (2-3 weeks).
- Creating a working navigation component
- Creating a search bar component that spans sitewide using key terms
- Creating multiple "helper" components
- Organizing components using Atomic Design
- Actively participating in code reviews
- Mentoring junior developers and other teammates
- Participating in code reviews
- Strategizing and planning for the overall success of the project
- Defect management
