## Spoiler Alert

> This is just a list of really cool technologies I've worked with this past year.

### Here's the Article about Astro

### Now back to the technologies

This year has been more of a breakout year for me as a developer. I feel like I've been having a renaissance in more than one way but, most obviously for me at least is just how many new languages, libraries, and frameworks I've come across and gained exposure to through working with them and trying new things. This entire website is something I read an article about which is featured above us now, and I just couldn't help but try to take it for a spin. So about 10 minutes after reading up on the documentation, I built this portfolio site in less than two evening's and it's really awesome. I've used everything under the sun from Next, Create-React-App, and some other flavors but, that's just scratching the surface so lets look at some other cool things I've been cooking with. When I started looking into how Astro was managing routes and the sheer speed of loading times, I knew I had to see what the hype was all about so that's how I ended up here. That's how I end up learning about a lot of things, just genuine curiosity in our field of work. Never stop experimenting and trying new stuff.

You hear people throw around sayings like, "never stop learning" or some other corny slogan you've heard 1000 times throughout your career as a developer but, it's true. You have to keep moving, adapting, and growing with the field and I for one am just really pumped that the scenery is always changing and it just keeps it really interesting for me day to day. My coffee order doesn't change much, but give technology a month or two and some new competitor will gladly enter the arena and be prepared to wow us. I'm here for it. I crave that kind of "bleeding edge" discovery of new tools that make what we do better. Who wouldn't want to know about the best tools available to do a really good job at something?

#### Check these out, I did and I'm pumped I got to work with recently.
