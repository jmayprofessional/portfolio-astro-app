My first job out of school, a massive family-owned company that spread across every major continent and known throughout the fishing and biking world as the "cream of the crop" when it came to melding technology and manufacturing as one. The principles instilled in my at my time at Shimano taught me the importance of timing, consistency, and the ins and outs of the corporate world. I had never worked in a large company prior to my experience here and at the time, we were experiencing a digital renaissance. Like most big companies, Shimano wasn't the most agile due to it's sheer size and moving parts. In my tenure at the company over the course of 2.5 I was able to contribute to overall progression in all of the following:

- complete rebrand of all major brand sites (Shimano, G.Loomis, Power Pro, and Jackall USA)
- launching of 2 major Ecommerce sites (Shimano and G.Loomis)
- major implimentation of SalesForce
- supporting documentation, tutorials, and in charge of administering training to our sales reps (50+)
- implimentation of a customer experience management software (Salsify)
- countless hours of sanitizing data for all makes and models in current rotation
- front end development
- project management and consulting throughout the design and implimentation phases of various new site additions
- international travel
- working closely with senior level executives such as Dave Pfeiffer (current president of Shimano North America Fishing at the time), Jim LaFrance (CFO), and Steve Ferarra (VP)
- contributed to a team that won multiple major awards at the industrie's largest expo every year (ICAST)
- coordination of extremely time sensitive material required for new product releases
- Managing deadlines and working both independently and with other departments in the company to achieve goals.
